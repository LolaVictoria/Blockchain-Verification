CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
1.1	BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
With the increasing occurrence of counterfeit goods, consumers may want to verify a product’s authenticity. As a result, (Chen and Ko, 2022) suggest there is a growing need for a platform that provides real-time supply chain information and product authentication for users. 
The counterfeit product problem is a significant challenge in today's global economy, affecting a wide range of items, from medicines and high-end consumer electronics to food products. These deceptive imitations not only endanger consumers but also undermine the reputation and profitability of legitimate businesses. (Batra, A., et al, 2024) says blockchain technology has emerged as a beacon of hope in the fight against counterfeit goods, revolutionizing the way authenticity is ensured. By harnessing the transformative capabilities of this technology, an unassailable barrier is created to safeguard product authenticity.
The adoption of blockchain technology in supply chain management has marked a transformative shift in transparency, efficiency, and reliability across the manufacturing and retail sectors. This study explores the ground breaking applications and advancements of blockchain-driven solutions in reshaping supply chain operations, improving traceability, and optimizing processes within these industries.
Blockchain technology, celebrated for its decentralized and tamper-proof ledger system, provides an unparalleled framework for revolutionizing supply chain management. It ensures a secure and transparent record of transactions and interactions throughout the value chain. In the manufacturing sector, blockchain-enabled solutions offer end-to-end visibility, allowing stakeholders to track goods, oversee production processes, and verify product authenticity with remarkable precision and efficiency. From sourcing raw materials and manufacturing to distribution and final delivery, blockchain-powered systems help manufacturers streamline operations, lower costs, and address risks such as counterfeiting and supply chain disruptions.
In the retail industry, blockchain technology presents significant opportunities to tackle persistent issues, including counterfeit products, ineffective inventory management, and opaque supply chains. By fostering greater transparency and accountability, blockchain solutions empower retailers to build trust and enhance operational efficiency across their value chains. Retailers can leverage blockchain-driven solutions to improve product traceability, verify the authenticity of goods, and streamline inventory management processes. 
To combat the pervasive issue of counterfeiting, a blockchain-based system is utilized to verify genuine products and detect counterfeit items, ensuring the authenticity of goods. This approach leverages the growing advancements in wireless technology, utilizing QR (Quick Response) codes and barcodes as powerful tools to reduce counterfeit practices. Using a camera scanner, the QR code or barcode of a product is linked to a blockchain that securely stores product details and a unique code for each item as blocks within the database. Upon scanning, the system validates the code. If a match is found, the customer is notified that the product is authentic. If not, the customer is alerted that the product is counterfeit, and, with their consent, the manufacturer is informed about the purchase location. This method empowers consumers by providing a reliable way to verify product authenticity without solely depending on merchants, fostering greater trust and transparency in the supply chain.

1.2	PROBLEM STATEMENT
The prevalence of counterfeit goods poses a significant threat to the global economy, affecting industries ranging from pharmaceuticals and electronics to food and consumer goods. Counterfeit products not only endanger consumer safety but also undermine the trust and profitability of legitimate businesses. Existing systems for verifying product authenticity often rely on merchant trust or third-party intermediaries, which may be insufficient to address the growing sophistication of counterfeit schemes.
Consumers today demand greater transparency in the supply chain, seeking information about product origins, manufacturing processes, and sustainability. However, traditional supply chain systems often lack the capability to provide real-time, tamper-proof records of product transactions and authenticity. This gap allows counterfeit goods to infiltrate markets, undermining consumer confidence and business integrity.
Blockchain technology, with its decentralized and immutable ledger system, offers a promising solution to these challenges. By integrating blockchain with technologies like QR codes and barcodes, products can be linked to a secure database that verifies their authenticity. Yet, despite its potential, the implementation of blockchain-based solutions in supply chain operations is still in its early stages, leaving a pressing need for more robust systems that can comprehensively combat counterfeiting while enhancing transparency and efficiency.
This study seeks to address these issues by exploring a blockchain-enabled approach to product authentication and supply chain transparency, leveraging advanced technologies to empower consumers and businesses in their fight against counterfeit goods.
